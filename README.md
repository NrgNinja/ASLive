Senior Design Project for Computer Science Students at the University of Central Florida

In this project, we are working on an ASL-to-text translation tool that can be used as an
extension for web browsers. Along with a large database of pre-formatted signs, a user can also
manually input any custom signs to their liking linked to their account. 

We will use ML and Robot Vision to convert signs to english text. One possible stretch goal is to
port this idea to a mobile application. 

In production from Jan 2024 - Dec 2024.
